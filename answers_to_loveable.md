## How to Respond to Lovable.dev’s Questions

### 1. Should we start with a prototype/MVP focusing on one specific workflow?

**Recommended Answer:**
Yes, starting with a prototype or MVP focused on a single, high-impact workflow is advisable. The most logical starting point is the **user input request form and AI-assisted scope development** workflow. This is the entry point for users and sets the foundation for the rest of the process. By validating this workflow, you can:

- Rapidly gather user feedback on usability and AI interactions.
- Demonstrate value by streamlining the most time-consuming part of procurement.
- Establish the data model and integration patterns that will support later stages (compliance, approvals, document assembly).

Once validated, subsequent workflows—such as procurement review, compliance checks, and document generation—can be layered in with reduced risk and clearer requirements.

### 2. Are there particular Canadian procurement regulations I should research for compliance features?

**Recommended Answer:**
Yes, compliance is critical for public sector procurement in Canada. Key regulations and policy frameworks to research and integrate include:

- **Federal Level:**
  - *Directive on the Management of Procurement* (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat): Sets out requirements for fairness, openness, transparency, and value for money in federal procurement[1].
  - *Government Contracts Regulations* (SOR/87-402): Governs the entry into contracts for goods, services, and construction[2].
  - *Code of Conduct for Procurement*: Covers conflict of interest, anti-corruption, and ethical conduct[3].
  - *Relevant Trade Agreements*: CFTA (Canadian Free Trade Agreement), CETA (Canada-EU), and others impose requirements on open competition and minimum posting periods[4][5].

- **Ontario (Broader Public Sector):**
  - *Broader Public Sector (BPS) Procurement Directive*: Applies to hospitals, school boards, colleges, universities, and other designated organizations[4][6].
  - *Supply Ontario Procurement Policy Restriction (U.S. Businesses)*: As of March 2025, restricts procurement from U.S. businesses for designated BPS organizations[6].

- **Other Considerations:**
  - Ensure the application supports audit trails, segregation of duties, and retention of procurement records as mandated by these regulations.
  - Review the *Procurement Ombudsman*’s guidance on restrictive requirements and dispute resolution[3].

### 3. Would you like to see a technical architecture diagram adapted for the Lovable platform?

**Recommended Answer:**
Yes, a technical architecture diagram tailored to the Lovable platform would be very helpful. It should illustrate:

- **Frontend:** How the user interface (e.g., React/Next.js) will interact with AI services and back-end APIs.
- **Backend:** Microservices, API gateways, and integration points for compliance validation and document assembly.
- **AI/LLM Integration:** Where and how large language models are invoked for scope generation, compliance checks, and user guidance.
- **Data Layer:** Storage solutions for documents, audit logs, and user data, ensuring compliance with data residency and privacy requirements.
- **Security:** Authentication, authorization, and audit logging mechanisms.
- **Deployment:** Cloud/on-premises options, scalability, and CI/CD pipeline integration.

Including this diagram early will ensure alignment between product requirements and technical implementation, and help identify any Lovable-specific constraints or optimizations.
