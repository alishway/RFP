# RFx Dev Assist Meeting Notes

**RFx Dev Assist**

The meeting discussed the development of an AI-driven tool for public sector institutions to streamline procurement processes.  The tool, named RFX Dev Assist, aims to automate the creation of solicitation documents, reducing inefficiencies and compliance issues.  Key features include a user input request form, scope development through AI interactions, and compliance checks against trade agreements and procurement directives.  The tool will generate RFP templates, evaluation criteria, and pricing forms, with procurement reviewing and approving the documents.  The goal is to create a phased, efficient system that can be expanded in the future.

**Action Items**
* Obtain documentation from the Procurement Ombudsman's office on criteria for restrictive requirements. 
* Explore the possibility of having the AI provide warnings or suggestions to the user on potentially restrictive requirements, rather than deciding on them. 
* Investigate the technical feasibility of hosting the AI component on-premises versus a public/private cloud solution, considering the sensitivity of the information involved. 
* Determine the appropriate level of AI involvement in the different stages of the process (user input, scope development, procurement review, RFx development). 

**Outline**

**RFx Dev Assist Overview**
* Speaker 1 explains the product's purpose: targeting public sector institutions to develop solicitation documents more efficiently. 
* The current procurement process involves multiple steps, including client requests, procurement department validation, and compliance checks. 
* The inefficiencies in the current process lead to challenges and cancellations, wasting time and resources. 
* The proposed solution, RFx Dev Assist, is designed specifically for public institutions in Canada, focusing on trade agreements and compliance. 

**User Input Request Form**
* Speaker 1 outlines the first step: a user input request form to streamline the procurement process. 
* The form will include details like requirements, criteria for selection, budget, and tasks/deliverables. 
* AI will assist in developing the scope document by interacting with the end user to clarify tasks and deliverables. 
* The AI will also identify restrictive requirements and provide suggestions to avoid them. 

**AI-Assisted Scope Development**
* The AI will interact with the end user to develop the scope document, ensuring it is clear and comprehensive. 
* The AI will also identify restrictive requirements and provide suggestions to avoid them. 
* The scope document will include an introduction, deliverables, tasks, timelines, and special requirements. 
* The AI will suggest mandatory requirements and scoring criteria for evaluating submissions. 

**Procurement Review and Compliance**
* The procurement review will involve a checklist to ensure compliance with trade agreements and procurement directives. 
* The AI will flag potential restrictive requirements and provide recommendations for modifications. 
* Budget approval and sufficiency will be validated with the finance department. 
* The AI will generate the RFX document, including the RFP template, evaluation methodology, and form of agreement. 

**Final Document Approval**
* The final document will be reviewed by the end user, who will approve specific sections. 
* The procurement team will review the document for compliance and make necessary edits. 
* The final approval will come from senior management, ensuring all checklists are met. 
* The approved document will be posted on the public platform, and the procurement process will be completed. 

**AI-Generated RFX Document**
* The AI will generate the RFX document, including the RFP template, evaluation methodology, and form of agreement. 
* The document will be populated with the information developed in the previous steps. 
* The AI will track changes, allowing the procurement team to review and approve the document. 
* The final document will be compliant with all relevant procurement directives and trade agreements. 

**User Interaction and AI Assistance**
* The AI will assist the end user in developing the scope document, ensuring all necessary details are included. 
* The AI will also identify restrictive requirements and provide suggestions to avoid them. 
* The user will have an unrestricted conversation with the AI, with potential flags issued during the procurement review. 
* The AI will generate the RFX document, including the RFP template, evaluation methodology, and form of agreement. 

**Compliance and Budget Validation**
* The procurement review will involve a checklist to ensure compliance with trade agreements and procurement directives. 
* The AI will flag potential restrictive requirements and provide recommendations for modifications. 
* Budget approval and sufficiency will be validated with the finance department. 
* The AI will generate the RFX document, including the RFP template, evaluation methodology, and form of agreement. 

**Final Document Approval Process**
* The final document will be reviewed by the end user, who will approve specific sections. 
* The procurement team will review the document for compliance and make necessary edits. 
* The final approval will come from senior management, ensuring all checklists are met. 
* The approved document will be posted on the public platform, and the procurement process will be completed. 

**AI-Generated RFX Document**
* The AI will generate the RFX document, including the RFP template, evaluation methodology, and form of agreement. 
* The document will be populated with the information developed in the previous steps. 
* The AI will track changes, allowing the procurement team to review and approve the document. 
* The final document will be compliant with all relevant procurement directives and trade agreements. 

**Amin 0:01**
All right, there we go. Okay, so, so this is what I did, right?  We we spoke about what the product is. So, essentially, it's a product to target public sector institutions to develop solicitation documents more efficiently.  Public sector institutions will never get rid of procurement department. They'll always have them.  Maybe they'll centralize them, what have you. But there will always be a procurement department.  The problem is right now, the way it works is internal.  Client will come and you know this process, they'll come and say, I want to procure the services of a data scientist.  Request goes to the procurement department. Procurement department goes back to the client and says, Okay, client, what do you want them to do?  What are the tasks and deliverables of this individual? Okay, so they give them the tasks and deliverables, then the procurement department will say, okay, what are the qualifications?  Let's, let's build a evaluation criteria so that if we get multiple submissions, we can get the best of the best.  What is your budget? So all these things are factors in the procurement process.  The problem with it, it's not efficient. The client is giving information. Procurement is asking the information back.  Procurement needs to validate. Is it compliant? Are they saying we need to procure coffee for this event, and the cup needs to be read and it has to have a T on it, all of a sudden it's a restrictive requirement.  You're not allowed that according to federal, provincial municipal procurement policies, even that for against trade agreements.  So there's checkpoints that procurement individuals need to do now, senior procurement people would know what those things are.  Junior intermediate may miss out on a few things. All of a sudden, the organization or the institution posts a solicitation and it's being challenged, a supplier comes back and says, Hey, we're Starbucks, we want to provide that, but you've made your your criteria too restrictive.  Why did you issue that all of a sudden? Cancel the require.  Cancel the procurement, reissue it waste of time, energy and money.  What I want to do is I want to create RFX dev assist.  What stands for our RFX is it could be RFP, RFQ, whatever, RFX development assist for public institutions.  The reason this is not open to all organizations private institutions is there's some nuances within the tool that will look at trade agreements that are applicable to public institutions.  So it's not a tool for every organization out there to use for their procurement.  It's for public institutions in Canada. Now, can we expand that in the future by changing what the tool is looking at for compliance.  Yes, we can, but initially it's a matter of creating a viable product that can be tested in the public space.  I'm doing RFPs right now. If we have a viable tool right now that we can at least test it, I'll utilize the tool to see how efficient where we need to tweak that's not a problem.  So it's probably a phased approach. We don't need to have all the bells and whistles in the beginning.  We just need to have a tool that can work. Okay.  Now what I did over here was create the steps of what the tool needs to go through in order to create a final solicitation document.  Okay, so step number one is the user input request form.  That means the end user is providing the details in one request form, rather than this back and forth of, oh, what are your requirements?  What is your criteria for selection? What is your budget? Have it in one spot?  Easy, clean, clean clean UI where the user is inputting.  Now the problem is the user sometimes they don't know anything.  They don't all they know is they want a data scientist.  Do they know the qualifications of what a data scientist should have?  No Do they know even what the tasks and deliverables are?  Maybe they do, but they need help in writing that stuff out.  Why should they go to procurement to get it written?  If AI can help them in the input, it eliminates hours, months of meetings completely.  So the first step is this, user input, request, form, scope development, which is, what is your background, what is the description of the service or the commodity you're purchasing, and what are the deliverables and tasks of the required resource?  This is where I want them to be able to say, I want a data scientist.  Then through an interaction, with ai, ai will ask them, What exactly will the data scientists be doing?  They'll put a they'll respond. So it's more of a chat.  All of a sudden, after the suggestion, because we provide suggestions, would these fit the deliverables of the data scientists?  Delivering report one, report to report three, whatever it is.  These are the tasks that you want the data scientists to do.  Analyze the data from XYZ, analyze from this system. So the AI is conversing with the end user to develop the scope document.  All. That's all it's doing. Now that the user has a scope in place, the AI, the AI needs to have some sort of intelligence to know that what is considered restrictive versus not so it needs to be able to understand that we cannot say in the scope document that we want coffee cups that are red and have a T in it because that is trying to create a restriction 

**Alireza 6:24**
documentation.  Are there any documentation that we can augment and teach AI to know the fine tune?  AI for like, is there like, when you say the restriction, so there must be some sort of a document you go and check, so you cannot have these with this 

**Unknown 6:39**
or, yeah.  So what we can do is we can leverage the procurement Ombudsman's office.  Okay, that the procurement ombudsman, what they do is they they essentially monitor the fairness of procurement in Canada for public organizations, and they have specific criteria of what is considered restrictive requirements versus not.  So I actually can provide that I might my contact.  Actually, I was sitting on the panel with him that that fellow, he's a contact of mine now, so we converse, and he's the procurement of buds for federal government so I can get that stuff from him.  Okay, that's not a problem, 

**Unknown 7:25**
because the thing is, now, let me tell you the first Yeah, the user, the you know, the target user, or whatever.  It has a conversational platform that is start like as if writing a chat right, says, Yeah, I want to hire a I need a data scientist doing this.  Just writes as much as it wants, okay? And then LLM right away summarizes it, and then start asking questions.  Okay? You want this guy to do these? These are the standard, typical things that select or tell me which one you want to include, okay?  And this guy says, this, this, this, you know, has to be a pop up or something that's 

**Unknown 8:03**
something easy that they're not typing too much.  Because one thing is that is very important to know these public sector and users, you know this better than anyone.  They're very lazy. No, I know they want simple. So maybe it's just, even just a click Include, click on the ones that you want to include, right, something very 

**Unknown 8:22**
list would include, go through the list, include what you want so and then over there in the back end, if, after created this, it will check with the what cannot go like, for example, in terms of data scientists, let's say what would be restricted.  I don't know, like, what a data science cannot do, or what so 

**Unknown 8:43**
for.  I'll give you an example of a restrictive requirement for a data scientist. 

**Unknown 8:49**
The data scientist must have 

**Unknown 8:55**
40 years of experience being a senior data scientist.  Okay, the reason that would be considered restrictive is not the 40 years is that there was no data science back then.  So now, all of a sudden, you're gonna pick, you're picking one guy who's 60 years old that you potentially know, right?  So you going and bidding for that, you'll be like, hey, no one has this. This is ridiculous.  That's restricted, but, 

**Unknown 9:22**
yeah, this is definitely could be so, but those are defined.  You know, we can train the model to also find for unreasonable or abnormal requests.  You know, there you go, and then abnormal course to be presented to the user.  Are you view really mean 40. While this is not on, this is not necessary.  And it says, yes, then you can just in the background.  You can look the LLM would have augment the content provided, yes, okay, you cannot use that.  So it would be a warning. Or it says, If you want to consider it, know that this will have a problem, you know, right?  So should I one decide for the user, it just provides the warning.  Or should it decide for the user, you know 

**Unknown 10:07**
what?  I wouldn't even want that in phase one, in the step one, you just want that.  Let them do what they want, actually, okay, let them 

**Unknown 10:15**
avoid them.  How to write, you know, 

**Unknown 10:18**
basically 

**Unknown 10:20**
the outline of what they need,  you know what?  Maybe even let them have this unrestricted conversation with the AI.  And then in the later phase, when it goes to procurement, is where flags are issued, because the way I conduct my procurement, the way, the reason my clients, like me, is I tell them, Go, say you want a coffee cup.  That's right, I will tell you where the risks are, and we'll figure that out after but, but right now, right now, do what you want.  Okay, so the first part is the scope, development, interaction. Second thing is obviously the timeline.  When do you need it by how long do you need it, etc. Third one is selection requirements.  What would you like the ideal data scientists to have? Do you want them to have experience in federal government?  Do you want them to have experience and in what do you want them to have a qualification?  Do you want them to have a PMP certification? What?  What do you need them to have again, conversation with the AI to develop the selection criteria, and the last one is budget tolerance.  They need to be able to either through a scale, like a sliding scale, to say I have all the money in the world, or I have zero.  I have very little money. What I want. I don't want them to only say I have $50,000 or I have 202 $100,000 what I want the initial one to be is to say, I'm restrictive, or it could be a radio button and saying, Do you have a budget?  Yes or No. If it's yes, form, yeah. Then, then, then they put their budget amount if it's no, then a scale comes up to say, Are you budget sensitive or your budget tolerant.  If you have all the money in the world, you put tolerant.  If it's sensitive this, then what the AI can do is say, okay, based on what, based on data scientists out there, industry rates, what you're looking for will take 100 hours of work at $1,000 an hour.  This is the budget that you need to have in place.  Again, whether that's in step one, step two or three, we can decide that so step one is only user interaction and user interaction with the AI to come up with the intake form, right user input form done AI generated scope and evaluation criteria.  Again, what I've written over here trade agreement and BPS compliant, for example, BPS is the broader public sector procurement directive, which is the procurement directive that applies to Ontario, Ontario public institutions.  Most there's ops or bps, we can discuss the nuances later, but bps, for example, schools in Ontario, school boards, school boards, hospitals, health care, things like that, universities, they fall under bps.  So there's a BPS broader public sector procurement directive that they have to follow these rules.  All procurement directives, whether it's federal, municipal or provincial, already are compliant with trade agreements.  So yes, we can say to the AI that you need to understand Kuzma trade agreement.  You need to understand Sita, uh, Canadian, European Trade Agreement, the internal trade agreement. You You need to understand those.  But you also need to understand if, if the client is an Ontario based hospital, it needs to understand the BPS procurement directive.  Okay, so this thing is that the step two is the AI is generating the whole thing.  Now what it's doing is it's taken the input, the discussion with the end user, and it's generated a scope of work which has an introduction, deliverables, tasks, timelines, special requirements, 

**Unknown 14:41**
ability to upload was 

**Unknown 14:42**
done by the procurement people or what the user both. 

**Unknown 14:45**
I want to eliminate that, kill that completely. It comes up with the mandatory requirements to say the data scientists must have a minimum of five years of experience 

**Unknown 15:01**
suggested by a large language model, correct, right? 

**Unknown 15:04**
It's taken the conversation, but now it's suggested it's coming up with criteria, technical criteria, which is scored.  This is not a pass. Fail, mandatory is our pass. Fail must have five years.  Scoring would be, if the person has five years, they will get one point.  If they have 10 years, they will get two points A scale. So it comes up with a rated criteria.  It comes up with a pricing form with data scientists. It's really the hourly rate, right? That's it. Other items.  Maybe they're looking for a list of Stationers. All of a sudden, this list would be pens.  This is the spec for the pens dollar. This is the erasers. This is whatever it is.  So it's a pricing form that's created by the LLM, RFX timelines. It needs to be compliant.  So when something is posted, typically publicly, it needs to go out on the market for 30 days.  What that relates to is the budget. 

**Unknown 16:10**
If the budget is over $121,000 

**Unknown 16:14**
specifically, it needs to be posted on mercs or an open competitive sourcing platform, which means it needs to be posted for a minimum of 30 days.  If it's less than that, then you can even post it for two weeks, although it there needs to be some reasonableness to it.  You can't go and say, I'm going to post this for three days and because it's only $50,000 and I want to get a data scientist, because at that point you already know who you want, and it's restrictive so our effects timelines, and the last thing is the estimated cost which it's going to now do an estimate that, oh well, for this scope of work and this qualification that you're looking for, this is going to take you approximately 100 hours at $1,000 and here is the amount, right?  It's $100,000 budget that you have. This is the estimated cost done so now AI is generated.  All this, this information, we move into step three. Step three is the procurement review.  And what I'm saying is over here, AI assisted is very different than AI generated.  This is AI generated as the AI is producing it.  Ai assisted even up here, this is AI assisted because it's back and forth. So step three is procurement review.  Okay, procurement review is they're going to go through a checklist. Okay?  AI is going to tell it, this could be considered restrictive requirements.  Procurement will review it has the ability to modify. Are there restrictive evaluation criteria, right? 40 years requirement, ridiculous?  Is it restrictive scope? The cup needs to be read. That's restrictive scope. Our effects, timeline, compliance.  This is what I'm talking about. If it needs to be posted publicly, because it's a $200,000 requirement, needs to be posted for a minimum of 30 days.  AI is already recommended. It if the end user is saying, No, I need this to be done in two weeks, and I have a budget of 500,000 Well, that's not going to be allowed.  So AI is coming up with all of these flags for procurement to review. Okay, budget approval and sufficient budget.  This is going to cost approximately this procurement is going to validate.  Do we have the budget with the finance department? Do we have $100,000 for this?  Okay, step four, RFX development, AI generated, so procurement is not generating this right now.  Once I do this back and forth, this dance with the end user, I have to take all that information and now I'm now building the RFP.  When I'm building the RFP, it takes a significant amount of my time.  This is when I need quiet, restrictive time where I'm just working on it hours on end, and I'm making sure that schedule A is aligned with the scope of work, it's aligned with the evaluation methodology all of this stuff.  So in this situation, what essentially, I wanted to do is take all of that information that it's provided procurement is cleared and checked off all these items, saying, yes, it's compliant.  It's compliant. It's compliant. Typically, public sector organizations have a template of procurement.  They have an RFP template, or an RFQ template, an RFI template, what I want AI to do is, once it determines this is an RFP, it takes the RFP template of the organization, it populates that full RFP template with the information that has been that's been developed over here in step three or step two, and with procurement validation, and it populates it, it populates it and track change.  I don't want it to populate as if it's the final document, because once it populates and track change, procurement still needs to go and say, Yes, accepted, accepted, accepted all of this stuff, right?  So that's what I'm saying. User organization template, it needs to know that it will upload the evaluation methodology, the statement of work, the evaluation criteria, 

**Unknown 20:32**
form of agreement 

**Unknown 20:35**
within an RFP package, 

**Unknown 20:38**
typically, public sector organizations will have a form of agreement.  The form of agreement is essentially that final contract that needs to be signed between the successful supplier and the organization.  The form of agreement needs to also be aligned with the scope of work.  So for example, typically, formal agreements will have a standard limitation of liability clause that is for $2 million however, if it's a massive construction project that is being done, is 2 million liability sufficient for that to ask the contractor for no typically you want to ask them for $10 million or something like that, right?  So AI needs to be able to also adapt to the form of agreement, the standard agreement template that the public institution has to the requirements, and again, in track change so the procurement can see what is the changes that AI has generated here.  Okay. And then it also creates a posting notice. The posting notice is when you issue on Mercs.  So when you issue on mercs, there is usually a summary that is needs to be posted.  So when you go on mercs, or I go on bid and go, or what have you, you're gonna see the Ottawa Hospital.  RFP, number to H, 2025, zero, 95 for data scientist, the Ottawa Hospital requires a data scientist to do this.  Thank you. So Ottawa Hospital requires a data scientist for the purposes of their new campus development program, to review existing data that exists in multiple systems and to generate reports and recommendations to to speak to the efficiencies of various departments, Whatever it is.  So it creates a summary. 

**Unknown 22:42**
Now that goes back to procurement. 

**Unknown 22:46**
Procurement looks at it, and the final step is approvals. Procurement goes and checks off all these track changes.  Yes, accept, accept, accept. No, let's edit this. Accept, accept. Final document is done.  Goes into the final stage of approvals. Approvals first goes to the end user. 

**Unknown 23:07**
End users right now, 

**Unknown 23:09**
what procurement people normally do is just send them the whole document review.  Let me know if you accept this. It's not efficient.  End users do not care about procurement jargon and this whole RFP document.  All they care about is, what am I asking for?  What is the timeline of this RFP and how am I going to pick the successful proponent?  So this is where it's a little bit different, whereby what I do, typically, compared to other procurement people, is I'll go and I'll send them the full document, and I will tell them, Go to page this.  Look at article 3.5 confirm you're okay with that article.  Confirm you're okay with article 7.3 

**Unknown 23:56**
article 8.5 

**Unknown 23:58**
look at Schedule A in its entirety, and confirm you're good with the Schedule A, which is typically the Statement of Work.  Look at Schedule B, which is the mandatory requirement, all of that.  So I wanted to actually go through some sort of process where, after all, track changes have been accepted.  It goes to the end user. It identifies the end user. Go to this page, approve. They click Approve.  It goes to the next approval section, approve this. Approve, approval. End users approved. It goes back to procurement.  Procurement either sees not approved from end user and is able to address that, or end users approved everything.  Procurements five minutes they approve. And the final approval goes to some sort of compliance.  Typically, it goes to some sort of senior management in the procurement division to say, yes, everything is validated.  I can see procurement approved based on non restrictive requirements. It's, it's Bobby approved.  There's a Bobby act right now with the with the US, you can't go and procure the item from the US according to the provincial regulations.  Now, right over a specific threshold, you have to procure from within Ontario.  So the final approver looks at all these checklists to say approved, approval, approved.  Once it's done, goes back to procurement. You have your compliance approval post it.  So there are like this document is missing some of those nuances, but I wanted to create, 

**Unknown 25:35**
I can COVID with a rough sketch.  I can come up with an interactive view to see, actually how it should, like I can, I can see, then the details can go because the there's just a couple of things, if this is going to be sold to the government, or they're gonna use it, because you're gonna utilize llms, and again, I have to see some of these documents, or because I have to know what type of element LLM I can utilize, because some are require a lot of computation time, and those are need to be either Hosted on Cloud or they allow us.  Are these, some of the they will probably assuming these are public sector.  They will not like this to be hosted on on a cloud, they would probably like to be a dedicated, dedicated so to do that, you know, we can, we can come up with a package of what we deploy is like the same way any other software company tell them, Okay, give us a server I deploy inside your own local server.  But this like right now, private cloud is becoming big in government, so private cloud will solve the issue that we have, you know, but again, will be like, because that would impact architecture, you know, not.  It will not like. You can tweak it for every client, but it will not become one product per se, you know, because multiple products that work 

**Unknown 27:01**
differently.  Sorry, if I could just Yeah, I understand that the server may be, it may be.  They may want the server to be private versus cloud based public, but at the end of the day, their solicitation document, majority of the time is going to be posted on a public platform, so all of the input in here is going to be eventually shared, is going to be shared.  And so for that, I mean, there are occasions. I'll give you occasions where I will do of the RFP stage one to three, and the first gate is that the proponents submit, by a deadline, a non disclosure agreement.  Once they submit that, only then will those people get access to confidential files because they've signed a non disclosure agreement.  It's something that just came in my mind of where potentially they don't want to be sharing that information. 

**Unknown 28:07**
But I know that there are, 

**Unknown 28:12**
there are solutions out there right now, which are 

**Unknown 28:16**
public sector proposal development solutions for private sector submitting proposals where they're charging.  So one guy I met at the camsec thing, he has a solution for proposal development.  What he does is he charges annually for public hosted companies can just buy it $20,000 a year, but it's public, so if you have trade secrets, you have patents that you may want to include in your submissions, you might not want to use that, because you're going to put that on a public server.  But then he also has that second option for those companies, which is $80,000 a year, and you get a dedicated server.  So I think similarly with this 

**Unknown 29:11**
will be the same, same type of solution.  But the thing is, this is there is a workflow in this, you know, starting the statement of work by the user, you know, and then going back and forth with the procurement, and every time there's a checkbox, so that means has to be a centralized application that will sync everything, okay, correct?  So to do that, to make, to make sure, like we could, we could, we could the LLM part, we could be hosted, if, if the see, if they right now, in defense, we have public cloud, so that would solve the issue, you know.  But if, let's say they don't have public cloud, they want to be still traditional server based, you know, in the data warehouse, like shared services, give them a rack, you know, just you can put it here, like we offer them the server, you know, but the inside of the program, the server needs access to LLM, outside with APIs, because if you want to host LLM, suddenly they need millions of dollars on actual servers, depending on how big.  Because right now I want to know, how big are these things?  Because if they're just 1000 pages of guidelines and, you know, follow ups, we can see take a simple embedded in the program, you know, lightweight.  They call it a small, large, a small language model.  But again, if it gets bigger, because the demand comes, they're gonna throw at you.  You always better off to always go with the best solution.  So you can easily add it module, the changer module. So let me look into this. What I do?  I take, can you send me the whatever you transcribe to US itself.
